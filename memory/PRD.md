# BookMyVenue - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a "managed event booking platform" named BookMyVenue. Core business model: customers submit requirements, a dedicated Relationship Manager (RM) coordinates with venues to facilitate the booking.

## User Personas
- **Customer**: Submits event requirements, interacts with RM, books venue
- **Relationship Manager (RM)**: Manages leads, coordinates with venues, handles customers
- **Admin**: Platform oversight, analytics, manages RMs and venues
- **Venue Owner**: Lists and manages venues on the platform

## Core Requirements
